## 1. Problem Definition

### Current Challenges
Traditional supply chains face several critical challenges that impact sustainability and transparency:

* **Limited Traceability**
  - Difficulty tracking products from origin to consumer
  - Lack of verification for sustainability claims
  - Incomplete visibility into supplier practices

* **Environmental Impact**
  - Carbon footprint measurement gaps
  - Inefficient resource utilization
  - Waste management issues

* **Data Reliability**
  - Manual record-keeping prone to errors
  - Fragmented data across multiple systems
  - Risk of fraudulent sustainability claims

### Impact Areas
1. **Business Operations**
   - Increased operational costs
   - Compliance risks
   - Reputation management challenges

2. **Consumer Trust**
   - Skepticism about sustainability claims
   - Limited access to product origin information
   - Growing demand for transparency

3. **Environmental Sustainability**
   - Difficulty measuring environmental impact
   - Challenges in implementing circular economy practices
   - Limited ability to verify green initiatives

## 2. Solution Overview
